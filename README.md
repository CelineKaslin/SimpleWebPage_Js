# Simple Web Page JS #

My goal was to create a simple page web app in JS, to "play around" with JS.
I have decided to create a memory list, which is like a Todo list.
The user can enter some things that they do not want to forget about and it will be displayed in an ordered list.
The data is not actually stored in a DB, so every time the page will be refreshed, the data will be deleted.

## How to use ##

1. clone the repo<br/>
Under the repo name click *clone or download*<br/>
Click on *use HTTPs*, copy the clone URL of the repo<br/>
In the terminal go on the working directory where you want the cloned directory to be<br/>
Use the `git clone` command and paste the clone URL then press enter :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repositary.git
```

2. On your local machine go inside of the ** directory :

```shell
$ cd
```
3. You can see the different files by using the `ls` command :br/>

```shell
$ ls
```

4. You can open the *.js* file that you want to read and change the code in your text editor or using `vim` :

```shell
$ vim wanted_exercise_file.js
```
Or you can just read the contains of it from the command line with `cat` :

```shell
$ cat wanted_exercise_file.js
```

## Run the app ##

1. On your command line use the `pwd` command to see the paath of your *html* file:

```shell
$ pwd
$ /Users/yourUsername/Desktop/directory-of-your-project/
```
